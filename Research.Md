## JOB MARKET PAPER

> ### Abstract
> Agricultural price supply response is thought to occur mainly through changes in acreage rather
than through yield increase. Many studies find that yields respond weakly to prices, leading to the
counter-intuitive idea that yields are insensitive to prices.  In this paper, I argue that this result is
likely due to the use of aggregated data: county- or state-level yields are averages, whose composition itself 
is affected by price changes. When area expansion is done by cultivating less fertile fields
or by foregoing rotation, this composition effect reduces average yields, even if yields increase on
each individual field.
>
> To disentangle the effect of the intensive and composition effect on county-level yields, I will run
an analysis at the field level.  Taking advantage of the availability of remotely-sensed crop choice
and yield data for close to one million fields in the US Midwest, I will be able to analyse response
effects separately for fields in mono-culture and in rotation, and to obtain estimates of the intensive
versus rotational effects on yields.  Using this measure, I intend to reconstruct county-level yields,
and investigate the offsetting effects of intensive and rotational margin on aggregate yields
