  <h1>Overview</h1>
   <p>I am an environmental and agricultural economist specialized in using satellite data techniques to gain new insights in economics. 
     I am an Assistant Professor in economics at the <a href="https://www.unige.ch/gsem/en/research/institutes/iee/"> University of Geneva</a>, which I joined with a 2023 SNF Starting Grant.
     I obtained my PhD from <a href="http://are.ucdavis.edu/en/">UC Davis- Agricultural Economics</a>, 
     was a post-doctoral Fellow at <a href="https://fse.fsi.stanford.edu/">Stanford's Center for Food Security and the Environment</a>, 
     and a Research Associate at the Environmental Policy Lab at ETH Zurich. 
       
  <p> In my  <a href="https://matthieustigler.github.io/Research">research</a> harnessing the impressive progress of satellite technologies,
    I studied the <a href="https://matthieustigler.github.io/docs/yield_response_satellite_Stigler.pdf">dynamics of agricultural expansion</a> over two million fields in the US, analyzed new solutions for agricultural risk management 
    in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12544">US</a> and in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajae.12375">Kenya</a>, and am currently investigating policies to reduce deforestation in the Amazon and Indonesia.</p> 
    <p>At the methodological level, another part of my research focuses on the econometric challenges raised by such big data. 
    I have been working on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05322-8"> adjusting satellite prediction techniques for causal inference</a> and developing a 
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14611">new asymptotic theory</a> for the ultra-high dimensionality encountered with satellite data.
