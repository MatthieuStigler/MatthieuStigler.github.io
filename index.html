  <h1>Overview</h1>
   <p>I am an agricultural and development economist specialized in using satellite data techniques to gain new insights in economics. 
     I am currently a Research Associate at the <a href="https://epl.ethz.ch/">Environmental and Policy Lab</a></p> at ETH Zurich. Before that, I was a post-doctoral Fellow at <a href="https://fse.fsi.stanford.edu/">Stanford's Center for Food Security and the Environment</a>, 
     and obtained my PhD from <a href="http://are.ucdavis.edu/en/">UC Davis- Agricultural Economics</a></p>
  
  <p> In my  <a href="https://matthieustigler.github.io/Research">research</a>, I use big data techniques like remote sensing of satellite data to assemble a very large dataset 
    of field-level yields for corn and soybeans in the US Midwest. 
    
    In my <a href="https://matthieustigler.github.io/docs/yield_response_satellite_Stigler.pdf">dissertation</a>, I showed that supply response has been previously under-estimated, 
    due to a composition bias where higher prices induce not only an increase in yields, but also an increase in fields with lower yields. 
    In a <a href="https://github.com/MatthieuStigler/MatthieuStigler.github.io/raw/master/docs/cropIns_paper_latest.pdf">recent paper</a>, I investigate how this dataset can help us understand a puzzle in crop insurance, the very limited success of index insurance.  </p>
