  <h1>Overview</h1>
  I am a first-year PhD student at (UC Davis, Agricultural Economics)[http://are.ucdavis.edu/en/] with special interest in agricultural and development economics, with a touch of applied econometrics. 
  You will find on this small blog a short description of my research, teaching, and the statistical packages I worked on.
