  <h1>Overview</h1>
   <p>I am an agricultural and development economist specialized in using satellite data techniques to gain new insights in economics. 
     I am currently a post-doctoral Fellow at <a href="https://fse.fsi.stanford.edu/">Stanford's Center for Food Security and the Environment</a>, and obtained my PhD from 
     <a href="http://are.ucdavis.edu/en/">UC Davis- Agricultural Economics</a> with special interest in agricultural and development economics, with a touch of applied econometrics. 
  
  In my dissertation,  <i> "Supply response at the field level: disentangling area and yield effects"</i>, I use big data techniques, namely remote sensing of satellite data, to  assemble a unique dataset of field-level yields for corn and soybeans 
in the US Midwest. Using this new dataset, I show that supply response has been previously under-estimated, 
     due to a composition bias where higher prices induce not only an increase in yields, but also an increase in fields with lower yields. </p>
