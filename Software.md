## Statistical packages

### Main R packages I maintain/develop:

 - [tsDyn](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tsDyn/index.html "tsDyn"): Non-linear regime switching models, in particular threshold cointegration in R, 
 - [RDDtools](https://github.com/MatthieuStigler/RDDtools "RDDtools"): A toolbox for Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD)
 - [multiDiff](https://github.com/MatthieuStigler/multiDiff) Multi-period diff-diff as discussed in Imai and Kim (2019) and Chaisemartin and Hautfeuille (2019).
 - [seglm](https://github.com/MatthieuStigler/seglm) Segmented/threshold regression methods. 

### Other R packages I have worked on:

 - [partsm](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/partsm/index.html) **Orphaned** package I **adopted** on Periodic Autoregressive Time Series Models. 
 - [RcompHam94](https://github.com/MatthieuStigler/RcompHam94/blob/master/pkg/inst/doc/Companion.pdf?raw=true) Replicating Hamilton's Time Series Analysis
 - [RCompAngrist](https://github.com/MatthieuStigler/RCompAngrist/) Replicating Mostly Harmless Econometrics in R

### Un-packaged code:

 - [Covariate decomposition](https://github.com/MatthieuStigler/Misconometrics/tree/master/Gelbach_decompo) R code for Gelbach (2016) When Do Covariates Matter? And Which Ones, and How Much? Journal of Labor Economics, 2016, vol. 34(2)
 - [Fixed-effects decomposition](https://github.com/MatthieuStigler/Misconometrics/blob/master/panel_stuff/gibbons_heterogeneous_FE_formula.R) R script for Gibbons et al (2019) "Broken or Fixed Effects?," Journal of Econometric Methods, vol. 8(1), pages 1-12, 
 - [Random forests as local kernel](https://github.com/MatthieuStigler/Misconometrics/blob/master/forests_as_knn/forest_as_knn.Rmd) Didactical code to illustrate Lin  and  Jeon (2006) Random  forests  and  adaptive  nearest  neighbors. Journal  of  the  American Statistical Association, 101(474):578â€“590
 - [IDW interpolation with spatial regression](https://github.com/MatthieuStigler/Misc/blob/master/spatial/interpolate_gwr.Rmd) Didactical code to illustrate the link between inverse-distance-weighted interpolation and spatially weighted regression
