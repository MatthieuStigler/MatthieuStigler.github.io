# Post-doc position
I am hiring for a post-doc to work on deforestation with structural/spatial methods, see the posting: https://econjobmarket.org/positions/10410

# PhD position

 As part of a Swiss SNF funded research on deforestation in Brazil, I will have budget for a PhD student and 
 would like to encourage and support a student interested in environmental economics to apply for the PhD program 
 in economics of the Geneva school of Economics and Management (GSEM), part of Geneva University.

The funded project aims to develop structural models of the Brazilian cattle supply chain and
evaluate the counterfactual impact of the forthcoming EU zero-deforestation ban (EUDR).
The ideal candidate will have a strong background in economic modeling and econometrics, 
familiarity with R (or eventually Python) for big geo-referenced datasets, 
interest in the topic of deforestation and ideally exposure to the Brazilian context/language.

This call is only a pre-selection step to find a candidate whom we will help and support 
for the formal GSEM department PhD application (candidates are still free to apply directly on their own). 
If accepted for the GSEM PhD program, the candidate will attend the GSEM first year doctoral school with a stipend, 
and then will be able to join the project as a research assistant with a project-specific stipend
at the end of the first year. 
Working as research assistant on this project does not impose any constraint on the selected student in terms of 
choice of supervisor or topic for the dissertation. 
All other information about the PhD program in economics at GSEM can be found here: https://www.unige.ch/gsem/en/programs/phd/economics/


Interested candidates should send a cover letter explaining their interest and skills, together with a CV, 
to Matthieu.Stigler+phd@gmail.com by Sunday 19 February.
